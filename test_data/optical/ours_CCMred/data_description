These files are the corresponding mcmc_find_parameters.py for each AOS 2013/2015 system.
The MCMC for these run on our version of model_flux_ratio.py that I think *best* matches
that of AOS2013:

-Includes:
	- Only optical HeI lines
	- Temperature prior from ITS2007 Te[OIII]
	- Hydrogen emissivities: Hummer & Storey 1987, AOS2010 reparameterization
	- Helium emissivities: Porter 2013, kx=ky=1 linear RBS interpolation; includes C/R correction
	- Reddening: CCM 1989 reddening curve

- 11 Feb 2019
	- added temperature prior from ITS2007 (had no prior previously on mistake..!)
